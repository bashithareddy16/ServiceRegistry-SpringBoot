The Service Registry Layer is crucial for initializing the components of the Payment Service, Product Service, and Order Service. It ensures seamless communication between these services and the Eureka server.

I have successfully created a Docker container for the Service Registry layer, and I would like to share the command to pull the corresponding image. Please use the following command to pull the image:

docker pull bashitha/serviceregistry - This command will retrieve the Docker image from the designated repository.

Here is the link for the docker image - https://hub.docker.com/r/bashitha/serviceregistry
